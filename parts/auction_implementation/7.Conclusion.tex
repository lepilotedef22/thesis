\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec-conclusion}
We have introduced a generic protocol for anonymous fair trade using
only standard cryptographic building blocks. The confidentiality and
anonymity properties are achieved using \gls{dvrs} and the
transparency and auditability of blockchain platforms is leveraged in
order to make the auction process publicly verifiable.  In this paper,
we assume the existence of a blockchain facilitating anonymous and
confidential transactions. We also analyzed the
efficiency of using such cryptographic primitives on Ethereum blockchain
and investigate the complexity and vulnerabilities that a blockchain
environment might introduce during implementation. In a future work, we intend to further analyze the performance of designed system on an existing privacy preserving blockchain.
