 %The fair trading of digital goods and services in a competitive market is not straightforward to achieve in a situation where each party has counter interests. The merchants and consumers tend to engage in contracts best aligned with their own strategy. Moreover, in financial markets, the merchants would prefer not to disclose their interests to other competitors. Keeping the anonymity paramount, they want to avail equal opportunities and participate in every possible trading. Auctions are the appropriate method to facilitate such competitive tradings. Substituting traditional auctions with blockchain auctions is a transparent and secure advancement. In this paper, we firstly focus on analyzing specific requirements for anonymous fair trade and then we put forward a generic designated verifier blockchain-based auction protocol guaranteeing bid confidentiality and bidders anonymity. Our construction blends anonymous signature and designated verifier signature. In contrast to existing work, we present a tailored formal model for auctions facilitating anonymity to bidders until they disclose their identity themselves.
%  We achieve full anonymity and also enabling exclusive access of bids to auctioneer only.
%  and our estimated gas cost evaluation on Ethereum blockchain determine minimal significant overhead. 
%  Our scheme is scalable as the choice of ring size depends on the bidder. 
%  The resultant ring signature ethereum
