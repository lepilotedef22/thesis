\section{Conclusion and Future Work}%
\label{sec-conclusion}%

	We have introduced a generic protocol for anonymous fair auction using only standard cryptographic building blocks. The confidentiality and anonymity properties are achieved using \gls{dvrs} and the transparency and auditability of blockchain platforms is leveraged in order to make the auction process publicly verifiable. In a future work, we intend to investigate the complexity and vulnerabilities that a blockchain environment might introduce.
