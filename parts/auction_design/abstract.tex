\begin{abstract}
%The fair trading of digital goods and services in a competitive market is not straightforward to achieve in a situation where each party has counter interests. Moreover, in financial markets, the merchants would prefer not to disclose their interests to other competitors. Keeping the anonymity paramount, they want to avail equal opportunities and participate in every possible trading. Auctions are the appropriate method to facilitate such competitive tradings. Substituting traditional auctions with blockchain auctions is a transparent and secure advancement. In this paper, we firstly focus on analyzing specific requirements for anonymous fair trade and then we put forward a generic designated verifier blockchain-based auction protocol guaranteeing bid confidentiality and bidders anonymity. Our construction blends anonymous signature and designated verifier signature. In contrast to existing work, we present a tailored formal model for auctions facilitating anonymity to bidders until they disclose their identity themselves.
Online auction systems allow to achieve an optimal trading of digital goods and services in a competitive market. Existing blockchain-based auctions allow the bidders to take part in the process while maintaining the confidentiality of their bids in a decentralized, transparent, secure and auditable way. However, in a competitive market, parties would prefer not to disclose their interests to competitors, and to remain anonymous during auctions. In this paper, we firstly analyze the specific requirements for blockchain-based anonymous fair auctions. We propose a formal model tailored to study auction systems facilitating anonymity, and we put forward a generic protocol relying on existing cryptographic primitives, such as designated verifier ring signature, to achieve bid confidentiality and bidder anonymity. Finally, we prove it to be secure against the security model we defined.
